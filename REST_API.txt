12. Give the mapping location of the variant rs499899635 in the zebrafish?

curl "http://rest.ensembl.org/variation/zebrafish/rs499899635" -H 'Content-type:application/json' 

RESULT: 
{"MAF":null,"ancestral_allele":null,"evidence":[],"minor_allele":null,"ambiguity":"Y","source":"Variants (including SNPs and indels) imported from dbSNP (mapped to GRCz11)","var_class":"SNP","synonyms":[],"name":"rs499899635","most_severe_consequence":"intergenic_variant","mappings":[{"end":10138412,"allele_string":"T/C","assembly_name":"GRCz11","start":10138412,"seq_region_name":"10","coord_system":"chromosome","location":"10:10138412-10138412","strand":1}]}

Mapping location: "location":"10:10138412-10138412" (in "mappings" array)
	
13. Give the first 100 bases of the genomic FASTA sequence of the Notch1 gene in the mouse.

Steps: 
- Taxonomy browser -> mus musculus (taxonomy ID: 10090) -> Gene: link to NCBI gene -> search for correct gene for mus musculus 
- Notch1 gene: NC_000068.7 -> Chromosome 2: 26457902..26503822) 
- First 100 bases: 26.457.902 + 100 =  26.458.002

curl "http://rest.ensembl.org/sequence/region/mouse/2:26457902..26458002?type=genomic" -H 'Content-type:text/x-fasta' 

RESULT:
