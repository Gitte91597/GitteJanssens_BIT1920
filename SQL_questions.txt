######### SQL questions

4. Give the name and length of the third largest gene in the genome.

select (seq_region_end-seq_region_start+1) AS gene_length, gene_name from gene
order by gene_length desc limit 1 offset 2;

RESULT: 
	Gene length: 2493040	Gene name: PARP1

5. Give the name of the gene with the most exons? Give the number of exons of this gene?

select count(*) AS count, gene_name  from gene g 
join transcript t on t.gene_id=g.gene_id 
join exon_transcript ext on ext.transcript_id=t.transcript_id 
join exon e on e.exon_id=ext.exon_id
group by gene_name
order by count desc
limit 1;

RESULT:
	Gene name: COL11A2	Nr of exons: 3598

6. 
a) Give the name of the chromosome with the most genes associated with breast cancer. 

select chromosome, count(*) as NrGenes from gene 
where description like '%breast_cancer%' 
group by chromosome 
order by NrGenes desc
limit 1;

RESULT: 
	Chromosome: 16		NrGenes: 2


b) Give the number of transcripts of this chromosome? 

select chromosome, count(*) as NrTranscripts from gene g
join transcript t on g.gene_id = t.gene_id
where chromosome=16
group by chromosome 
order by NrTranscripts desc;

RESULT:
	Chromosome: 16		NrTranscripts: 3636

7. 
a) Give the number of rows from the exon table and do the same for the exon_transcript table. 

select count(*) from exon;		RESULT: 642.590
select count(*) from exon_transcript;	RESULT: 1.178.393

b) Explain why there is a difference in number of rows.

A single exon can code for plural transcripts, but one transcript can also contain plural exons. Since all the relations between every single exon and transcript are in the exon_transcript table, the table is longer.
